          Understanding what your step-by-step guide should include and actually assembling it are, 
          of course, two totally different prospects. The biggest reason is that creating an effective 
          how-to or step-by-step guide necessarily means getting very detailed and granular.

          Here’s a simple breakdown of the steps you need to take to create a how-to guide (last time 
          we’re getting so meta, I promise):

        <ol>
          <li>
            Name the process or task
          </li>
          <li>
            Establish the individuals or departments responsible for carrying out the process, 
            and determine who in the organization is responsible for monitoring and improving upon the process, 
            if necessary
          </li>
          <li>
            Identify the ideal steps involved in completing the process or task successfully. 
            Interview team members if needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Document the steps with all the details required. Think of your target audience when you 
            write down the steps — make sure you use language that they can relate to. Also consider using 
            visuals here — popular options include flow charts, checklists and standard operating procedures, 
            among others.
          </li>
          <li>
            Determine if or when it’s ever appropriate to deviate from the process, and, if so, 
            describe scenarios where this might occur
          </li>
          <li>
            Put the process into practice and monitor its success or failure; consider what steps can be 
            taken to improve it and implement them, again reviewing for success
          </li>
