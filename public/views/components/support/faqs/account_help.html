    Song by The Beatles:
    I need somebody
    (Help) not just anybody
    (Help) you know I need someone, help
    So much younger than today
    (I never need) I never needed anybody's help in any way
    (Now) but now these days are gone (these days are gone)
    I'm not so self assured
    (And now I find) now I find I've changed my mind
    And opened up the doors
    Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
    And I do appreciate you being 'round
    Help me get my feet back on the ground
    Won't you please, please help me
    In oh so many ways
    (My independ-) my independence seems to vanish 
  </p>
